                        <h1>Exposure</h1>
                        Exposure is the foundation of photography, determining how light or dark an image appears. It involves three key settings: Shutter Speed – Controls how long the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. A fast shutter speed freezes motion, while a slow shutter speed captures motion blur. Aperture – Adjusts the size of the lens opening. A wider aperture (lower f-stop) lets in more light and creates a blurry background, while a narrow aperture (higher f-stop) keeps more of the scene in focus. ISO – Measures the camera’s sensitivity to light. A low ISO (100–200) keeps images sharp in bright conditions, while a higher ISO (800+) is useful in low light but can introduce grain</div>

                        <h1>Composition</h1>
                        Composition Rules Composition is how elements are arranged in a photo. Rule of Thirds – Dividing the frame into nine sections and placing key subjects along these lines creates balanced images. Leading Lines – Using roads, fences, or pathways to draw the viewer’s eye toward the subject. Framing – Positioning objects around the edges of an image to focus attention on the subject.</div>

                        <h1>Lighting</h1>
                        Lighting Techniques Lighting affects mood and clarity. Natural light is ideal for soft, flattering tones, while artificial light allows more control indoors. Learning how to manipulate light enhances the quality of photos. Focus and Depth of Field Blurring the background (shallow depth of field) isolates the subject, while a deep depth of field keeps everything sharp. Mastering focus ensures clear, professional-looking shots. By practicing these techniques, you’ll gain the skills to capture breathtaking images in any situation.</div>
