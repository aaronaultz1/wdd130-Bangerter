                <p>Photography involves mastering camera settings like shutter speed, aperture, and ISO to control exposure, along with understanding lighting techniques to enhance composition. Post-processing through editing tools like Lightroom and Photoshop helps refine images by adjusting colors and contrast. Applying composition rules such as the rule of thirds and leading lines improves visual appeal. Exploring different photography styles and drawing inspiration from professionals can spark creativity and personal expression. By developing these skills, you can capture compelling images and unlock endless creative possibilities.</p>
